      HIS &ldquo;DAY IN COURT&rdquo;
     </h1>
    <h2>
      By Charles Egbert Craddock <br /><br /> 1895
    </h2>

    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a hard winter along the slopes of the Great Smoky Mountains,
      and still the towering treeless domes were covered with snow, and the
      vagrant winds were abroad, rioting among the clifty heights where they
      held their tryst, or raiding down into the sheltered depths of the Cove,
      where they seldom intruded. Nevertheless, on this turbulent rush was borne
      in the fair spring of the year. The fragrance of the budding wild-cherry
      was to be discerned amidst the keen slanting javelins of the rain. A
      cognition of the renewal and the expanding of the forces of nature
      pervaded the senses as distinctly as if one might hear the grass growing,
      or feel along the chill currents of the air the vernal pulses thrill.
      Night after night in the rifts of the breaking clouds close to the horizon
      was glimpsed the stately sidereal Virgo, prefiguring and promising the
      harvest, holding in her hand a gleaming ear of corn. But it was not the
      constellation which the tumultuous torrent at the mountain's base
      reflected in a starry glitter. From the hill-side above a light cast its
      broken image among the ripples, as it shone for an instant through the
      bosky laurel, white, stellular, splendid&mdash;only a tallow dip suddenly
      placed in the window of a log-cabin, and as suddenly withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a gruff voice within growled out a remonstrance: &ldquo;What ye doin' that
      fur, Steve? Hev that thar candle got enny call ter bide in that thar
      winder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interior, contrary to the customary aspect of the humble homes of the
      region, was in great disarray. Cooking utensils stood uncleaned about the
      hearth; dishes and bowls of earthen-ware were assembled upon the table in
      such numbers as to suggest that several meals had been eaten without the
      ceremony of laying the cloth anew, and that in default of washing the
      crockery it had been re-enforced from the shelf so far as the limited
      store might admit. Saddles and spinning-wheels, an ox-yoke and
      trace-chains, reels and wash-tubs, were incongruously pushed together in
      the corners. Only one of the three men in the room made any effort to
      reduce the confusion to order. This was the square-faced, black-bearded,
      thick-set young fellow who took the candle from the window, and now
      advanced with it toward the hearth, holding it at an angle that caused the
      flame to swiftly melt the tallow, which dripped generously upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev seen Eveliny do it,&rdquo; he said, excitedly justifying himself. &ldquo;I
      noticed her sot the candle in the winder jes' las' night arter supper.&rdquo; He
      glanced about uncertainly, and his patience seemed to give way suddenly.
      &ldquo;Dad-burn the old candle! I dunno <i>whar</i> ter set it,&rdquo; he cried,
      desperately, as he flung it from him, and it fell upon the floor close to
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dogs lifted their heads to look, and one soft-stepping old hound got
      up with the nimbleness of expectation, and, with a prescient gratitude
      astir in his tail, went and sniffed at it. His aspect drooped suddenly,
      and he looked around in reproach at Stephen Quimbey, as if suspecting a
      practical joke. But there was no merriment in the young mountaineer's
      face. He threw himself into his chair with a heavy sigh, and desisted for
      a time from the unaccustomed duty of clearing away the dishes after
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' 'ain't ye got the gumption ter sense what Eveliny sot the candle in
      the winder fur?&rdquo; his brother Timothy demanded, abruptly&mdash;&ldquo;ez a sign
      ter that thar durned Abs'lom Kittredge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other two men turned their heads and looked at the speaker with a
      poignant intensity of interest. &ldquo;I 'lowed ez much when I seen that light
      ez I war a-kemin' home las' night,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;it shined spang down
      the slope acrost the ruver an' through all the laurel; it looked plumb
      like a star that hed fell ter yearth in that pitch-black night. I dun-no
      how I s'picioned it, but ez I stood thar an' gazed I knowed somebody war
      a-standin' an' gazin' too on the foot-bredge a mite ahead o' me. I
      couldn't see him, an' he couldn't turn back an' pass me, the bredge bein'
      too narrer. He war jes obligated ter go on. I hearn him breathe quick;
      then&mdash;pit-pat, pit-pat, ez he walked straight toward that light. An'
      he be 'bleeged ter hev hearn me, fur arter I crost I stopped. Nuthin'.
      Jes' a whisper o' wind, an' jes' a swishin' from the ruver. I knowed then
      he hed turned off inter the laurel. An' I went on, a-whistlin' ter make
      him 'low ez I never s'picioned nuthin'. An' I kem inter the house an' tole
      dad ez he'd better be a-lookin' arter Eveliny, fur I b'lieved she war
      a-settin' her head ter run away an' marry Abs'lom Kittredge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, I ain't right up an' down sati'fied we oughter done what we done,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Stephen, fretfully. &ldquo;It don't 'pear edzacly right fur three men
      ter fire on one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      Old Joel Quimbey, in his arm-chair in the chimney-corner, suddenly lifted
      his head&mdash;a thin head with fine white hair, short and sparse, upon
      it. His thin, lined face was clear-cut, with a pointed chin and an
      aquiline nose. He maintained an air of indignant and rebellious grief, and
      had hitherto sat silent, a gnarled and knotted hand on either arm of his
      chair. His eyes gleamed keenly from under his heavy brows as he turned his
      face upon his sons. &ldquo;How could we know thar warn't but one, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not been a candidate for justice of the peace for nothing; he had
      absorbed something of the methods and spirit of the law through sheer
      propinquity to the office. &ldquo;We-uns wouldn't be persumed ter <i>know</i>.&rdquo;
       And he ungrudgingly gave himself all the benefit of the doubt that the law
      accords.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a true word!&rdquo; exclaimed Stephen, quick to console his conscience.
      &ldquo;Jes' look at the fac's, now. We-uns in a plumb black midnight hear a man
      a-gittin' over our fence; we git our rifles; a-peekin' through the
      chinkin' we ketch a glimge o' him&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried out Timothy, with savage satisfaction, &ldquo;we seen him by the
      light she set her head him on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was tall and lank, with a delicately hooked nose, high cheek-bones,
      fierce dark eyes, and dark eyebrows, which were continually elevated,
      corrugating his forehead. His hair was black, short and straight, and he
      was clad in brown jeans, as were the others, with great cowhide boots
      reaching to the knee. He fixed his fiery intent gaze on his brother as the
      slower Stephen continued, &ldquo;An' so we blaze away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' one durned fool's so onlucky ez ter hit him an' not kill him,&rdquo;
       growled Timothy, again interrupting. &ldquo;An' so whilst Eveliny runs out
      a-screamin', 'He's dead! he's dead!&mdash;ye hev shot him dead!' we-uns
      make no doubt but he <i>is</i> dead, an' load up agin, lest his frien's
      mought rush in on we-uns whilst we hedn't no use o' our shootin'-irons.
      An' suddint&mdash;ye can't hear nuthin' but jes' a owel hoot-in' in the
      woods, or old Pa'son Bates's dogs a-howlin' acrost the Cove. An' we go out
      with a lantern, an' thar's jes' a pool o' blood in the dooryard, an'
      bloody tracks down ter the laurel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eveliny gone!&rdquo; cried the old man, smiting his hands together; &ldquo;my leetle
      darter! The only one ez never gin me enny trouble. I couldn't hev made out
      ter put up with this hyar worl' no longer when my wife died ef it hedn't
      been fur Eveliny. Boys war wild an' mischeevious, an' folks outside don't
      keer nuthin' 'bout ye&mdash;ef they <i>war</i> ter 'lect ye ter office
      'twould be ter keep some other feller from hevin' it, 'kase they 'spise
      him more'n ye. An' hyar she's runned off an' married old Tom Kittredge's
      gran'son, Josiah Kittredge's son&mdash;when our folks 'ain't spoke ter
      none o' 'em fur fifty year&mdash;Josiah Kittredge's son&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
       He laughed aloud in tuneless scorn of himself and of this freak of froward
      destiny and then fell to wringing his hands and calling upon Evelina.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flare from the great chimney-place genially played over the huddled
      confusion of the room and the brown logs of the wall, where the gigantic
      shadows of the three men mimicked their every gesture with grotesque
      exaggeration. The rainbow yarn on the warping bars, the strings of
      red-pepper hanging from the ceiling, the burnished metallic flash from the
      guns on their racks of deer antlers, served as incidents in the monotony
      of the alternate yellow flicker and brown shadow. Deep under the blaze the
      red coals pulsated, and in the farthest vistas of the fire quivered a
      white heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Tom Kittredge,&rdquo; the father resumed, after a time, &ldquo;he jes' branded
      yer gran'dad's cattle with his mark; he jes' cheated yer gran'dad, my dad,
      out'n six head o' cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said the warlike Timothy, not willing to lose sight of
      reprisal even in vague reminiscence, &ldquo;he hed only one hand ter rob with
      arter that, fur I hev hearn ez how when gran'dad got through with him the
      doctor hed ter take his arm off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sartainly, sartainly,&rdquo; admitted the old man, in quiet assent. &ldquo;An' Josiah
      Kittredge he put out the eyes of a horse critter o' mine right thar at the
      court-house door&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, arterward, we-uns fired his house over his head,&rdquo; put in Tim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' Josiah Kittredge an' me,&rdquo; the old man went on, &ldquo;we-uns clinched every
      time we met in this mortal life. Every time I go past the graveyard whar
      he be buried I kin feel his fingers on my throat. He had a nervy grip, but
      no variation; he always tuk holt the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tears like ter me ez 'twar a fust-rate time ter fetch out the rifles
      again,&rdquo; remarked Tim, &ldquo;this mornin', when old Pa'son Bates kem up hyar an'
      'lowed ez he hed married Eveliny ter Abs'lom Kittredge on his death-bed;
      'So be, pa'son,' I say. An' he tuk off his hat an' say, 'Thank the Lord,
      this will heal the breach an' make ye frien's!' An' I say, 'Edzacly,
      pa'son, ef it <i>air</i> Abs'lom's deathbed; but them Kittredges air so
      smilin' an' deceiv-in' I be powerful feared he'll cheat the King o'
      Terrors himself. I'll forgive 'em ennything&mdash;<i>over his grave?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pa'son war tuk toler'ble suddint in his temper,&rdquo; said the literal Steve.
      &ldquo;I hearn him call yer talk onchristian, cussed sentiments, ez he put out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye mus' keep up a Christian sperit, boys; that's the main thing,&rdquo; said
      the old man, who was esteemed very religious, and a pious Mentor in his
      own family. He gazed meditatively into the fire. &ldquo;What ailed Eveliny ter
      git so tuk up with this hyar Abs'-lom? What made her like him?&rdquo; he
      propounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His big eyes, edzacly like a buck's, an' his long yaller hair,&rdquo; sneered
      the discerning Timothy, with the valid scorn of a big ugly man for a slim
      pretty one. &ldquo;'Twar jes 'count o' his long yaller hair his mother called
      him Abs'lom. He war named Pete or Bob, I disremember what&mdash;suthin'
      common&mdash;till his hair got so long an' curly, an' he sot out ter be so
      plumb all-fired beautiful, an' his mother named him agin; this time
      Abs'lom, arter the king's son, 'count o' his yaller hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git hung by his hair some o' these days in the woods, like him the Bible
      tells about; that happened ter the sure-enough Abs'lom,&rdquo; suggested
      Stephen, hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw, sir,&rdquo; said Tim; &ldquo;when Abs'lom Kittredge gits hung it 'll be with
      suthin' stronger'n hair; he'll stretch hemp.&rdquo; He exchanged a glance of
      triumphant prediction with his brother, and anon gazed ruefully into the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye talk like ez ef he war goin' ter live, boys,&rdquo; said old Joel Quimbey,
      irritably. &ldquo;Pa'son 'lowed he war powerful low.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pa'son said he'd never hev got home alive 'thout she'd holped him,&rdquo; said
      Stephen. &ldquo;She jes' tuk him an' drug him plumb ter the bars, though I don't
      see how she done it, slim leetle critter ez she be; an' thar she holped
      him git on his beastis; an' then&mdash;I declar' I feel ez ef I could kill
      her fur a-demeanin' of herself so&mdash;she led that thar horse, him
      a-ridin' an' a-leanin' on the neck o' the beastis, two mile up the
      mountain, through the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, let her bide thar. I'll look on her face no mo',&rdquo; declared the old
      man, his toothless jaw shaking. &ldquo;Kittredge she be now, an' none o' the
      name kin come a-nigh me. How be I ever a-goin' 'bout 'mongst the folks at
      the settlement agin with my darter married ter a Kittredge? How Josiah an'
      his dad mus' be a-grinnin' in thar graves at me this night! An' I 'low
      they hev got suthin' ter grin about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly his grim face relaxed, and once more he began to smite his
      hands together and to call aloud for Evelina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy could offer no consolation, but stared dismally into the fire, and
      Stephen rose with a sigh and addressed himself to pushing the
      spinning-wheels and tubs and tables into the opposite corner of the room,
      in the hope of solving the enigma of its wonted order.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It seemed to Evelina afterward that when she climbed the rugged ways of
      the mountain slope in that momentous night she left forever in the depths
      of the Cove that free and careless young identity which she had been. She
      did not accurately discriminate the moment in which she began to realize
      that she was among her hereditary enemies, encompassed by a hatred
      nourished to full proportions and to a savage strength long before she
      drew her first breath. The fact only gradually claimed its share in her
      consciousness as the tension of anxiety for Absalom's sake relaxed, for
      the young mountaineer's strength and vitality were promptly reasserted,
      and he rallied from the wound and his pallid and forlorn estate with the
      recuperative power of the primitive man. By degrees she came to expect the
      covert unfriendly glances his brother cast upon her, the lowering averted
      mien of her sister-in-law, and now and again she surprised a long,
      lingering, curious gaze in his mother's eyes. They were all Kittredges!
      And she wondered how she could ever have dreamed that she might live
      happily among them&mdash;one of them, for her name was theirs. And then
      perhaps the young husband would stroll languidly in, with his long hair
      curling on his blue jeans coat-collar, and an assured smile in his dark
      brown eyes, and some lazy jest on his lips, certain of a welcoming laugh,
      for he had been so near to death that they all had a sense of acquisition
      in that he had been led back. For his sake they had said little; his
      mother would busy herself in brewing his &ldquo;yerb&rdquo; tea, and his brother would
      offer to saddle the mare if he felt that he could ride, and they would all
      be very friendly together; and his alien wife would presently slip out
      unnoticed into the &ldquo;gyarden spot,&rdquo; where the rows of vegetables grew as
      they did in the Cove, turning upon her the same neighborly looks they wore
      of yore, and showing not a strange leaf among them. The sunshine wrapped
      itself in its old fine gilded gossamer haze and drowsed upon the verdant
      slopes; the green jewelled &ldquo;Juny-bugs&rdquo; whirred in the soft air; the mould
      was as richly brown as in Joel Quimbey's own enclosure; the flag-lilies
      bloomed beside the onion bed; and the woolly green leaves of the sage wore
      their old delicate tint and gave out a familiar odor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among this quaint company of the garden borders she spent much of her
      time, now hoeing in a desultory fashion, now leaning on the long handle of
      the implement and looking away upon the far reaches of the purple
      mountains. As they stretched to vague distances they became blue, and
      farther on the great azure domes merged into a still more tender hue, and
      this in turn melted into a soft indeterminate tint that embellished the
      faint horizon. Her dreaming eyes would grow bright and wistful; her rich
      brown curling hair, set free by the yellow sun-bonnet that slipped off her
      head and upon her shoulders, would airily float backward in the wind;
      there was a lithe grace in the slender figure, albeit clad in a yellow
      homespun of a deep dye, and the faded purplish neckerchief was caught
      about a throat fairer even than the fair face, which was delicately
      flushed. Absalom's mother, standing beside Peter, the eldest son, in the
      doorway, watched her long one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all kem about from that thar bran dance,&rdquo; said Peter, a homely man,
      with a sterling, narrow-minded wife and an ascetic sense of religion.
      &ldquo;Thar Satan waits, an' he gits nimbler every time ye shake yer foot. The
      fiddler gin out the figger ter change partners, an' this hyar gal war
      dancin' opposite Abs'lom, ez hed never looked nigh her till that day. The
      gal didn't know <i>what</i> ter do; she jes' stood still; but Abs'lom he
      jes' danced up ter her ez keerless an' gay ez he always war, jes' like she
      war ennybody else, an' when he held out his han' she gin him hern, all
      a-trembly, an' lookin' up at him, plumb skeered ter death, her eyes all
      wide an' sorter wishful, like some wild thing trapped in the woods. An'
      then the durned fiddler, moved by the devil, I'll be be bound, plumb
      furgot ter change 'em back. So they danced haf'n the day tergether. An'
      arter that they war forever a-stealin' off an' accidentally meetin' at the
      spring, an' whenst he war a-huntin' or she drivin' up the cow, an'
      a-courtin' ginerally, till they war promised ter marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twarn't the bran dance; 'twar suthin' ez fleet-in' an' ez useless,&rdquo; said
      his mother, standing in the door and gazing at the unconscious girl, who
      was leaning upon the hoe, half in the shadow of the blooming laurel that
      crowded about the enclosure and bent over the rail fence, and half in the
      burnished sunshine; &ldquo;she's plumb beautiful&mdash;thar's the snare ez
      tangled Abs'lom's steps. I never 'lowed ter see the day ez could show enny
      comfort fur his dad bein' dead, but we hev been spared some o' the tallest
      cavortin' that ever war seen sence the Big Smoky war built. Sometimes it
      plumb skeers me ter think ez we-uns hev got a Quimbey abidin' up hyar
      along o' we-uns in <i>his</i> house an' a-callin' o' herse'f Kittredge. I
      looks ter see him a-stalkin' roun' hyar some night, too outdone an'
      aggervated ter rest in his grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the nights continued spectreless and peaceful on the Great Smoky, and
      the same serene stars shone above the mountain as over the Cove. Evelina
      could watch here, as often before, the rising moon ascending through a
      rugged gap in the range, suffusing the dusky purple slopes and the black
      crags on either hand with a pensive glamour, and revealing the river below
      by the amber reflection its light evoked. She often sat on the step of the
      porch, her elbow on her knees, her chin in her hand, following with her
      shining eyes the pearly white mists loitering among the ranges. Hear! a
      dog barks in the Cove, a cock crows, a horn is wound, far, far away; it
      echoes faintly. And once more only the sounds of the night&mdash;that
      vague stir in the windless woods, as if the forest breathes, the far-away
      tinkle of water hidden in the darkness&mdash;and the moon is among the
      summits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men remained within, for Absalom avoided the chill night air, and
      crouched over the smouldering fire. Peter's wife sedulously held aloof
      from the ostracized Quimbey woman. But her mother-in-law had fallen into
      the habit of sitting upon the porch these moonlit nights. The sparse,
      newly-leafed hop and gourd vines clambering to its roof were all
      delicately imaged on the floor, and the old woman's clumsy figure, her
      grotesque sun-bonnet, her awkward arm-chair, were faithfully reproduced in
      her shadow on the log wall of the cabin&mdash;even to the up-curling smoke
      from her pipe. Once she suddenly took the stem from her mouth. &ldquo;Eveliny,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;'pears like ter me ye talk mighty little. Thar ain't no use in
      gittin' tongue-tied up hyar on the mounting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evelina started and raised her eyes, dilated with a stare of amazement at
      this unexpected overture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't keerin',&rdquo; said the old woman, recklessly, to herself, although
      consciously recreant to the traditions of the family, and sacrificing with
      a pang her distorted sense of loyalty and duty to her kindlier impulse. &ldquo;I
      warn't born a Kittredge nohow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, 'm,&rdquo; said Evelina, meekly; &ldquo;but I don't feel much like talkin'
      noways; I never talked much, bein' nobody but men-folks ter our house. I'd
      ruther hear ye talk 'n talk myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen at ye now! The headin' young folks o' this kentry 'll never rest
      till they make thar elders shoulder <i>all</i> the burdens. An' what air
      ye wantin' a pore ole 'oman like me ter talk about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evelina hesitated a moment, then looked up, with a face radiant in the
      moonbeams. &ldquo;Tell all 'bout Abs'lom&mdash;afore I ever seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother laughed. &ldquo;Ye air a powerful fool, Eveliny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed a little, too. &ldquo;I dunno ez I want ter be no wiser,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one was his wife, and the other was his mother, and as they talked of
      him daily and long, the bond between them was complete.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev got 'em both plumb fooled,&rdquo; the handsome Absalom boasted at the
      settlement, when the gossips wondered once more, as they had often done,
      that there should be such unity of interest between old Joel Quimbey's
      daughter and old Josiah Kittredge's widow. As time went on many rumors of
      great peace on the mountain-side came to the father's ears, and he grew
      more testy daily as he grew visibly older. These rumors multiplied with
      the discovery that they were as wormwood and gall to him. Not that he
      wished his daughter to be unhappy, but the joy which was his grief and
      humiliation was needlessly flaunted into his face; the idlers about the
      county town had invariably a new budget of details, being supplied,
      somewhat maliciously, it must be confessed, by the Kittredges themselves.
      The ceremony of planting one foot on the neck of the vanquished was in
      their minds one of the essential concomitants of victory. The bold
      Absalom, not thoroughly known to either of the women who adored him, was
      ingenious in expedients, and had applied the knowledge gleaned from his
      wife's reminiscences of her home, her father, and her brothers to more
      accurately aim his darts. Sometimes old Quimbey would fairly flee the
      town, and betake himself in a towering rage to his deserted hearth, to
      brood futilely over the ashes, and devise impotent schemes of vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He often wondered afterward in dreary retrospection how he had survived
      that first troublous year after his daughter's elopement, when he was so
      lonely, so heavy-hearted at home, so harried and angered abroad. His
      comforts, it is true, were amply insured: a widowed sister had come to
      preside over his household&mdash;a deaf old woman, who had much to be
      thankful for in her infirmity, for Joel Quimbey in his youth, before he
      acquired religion, had been known as a singularly profane man&mdash;&ldquo;a
      mos' survigrus cusser&rdquo;&mdash;and something of his old proficiency had
      returned to him. Perhaps public sympathy for his troubles strengthened his
      hold upon the regard of the community. For it was in the second year of
      Evelina's marriage, in the splendid midsummer, when all the gifts of
      nature climax to a gorgeous perfection, and candidates become incumbents,
      that he unexpectedly attained the great ambition of his life. He was said
      to have made the race for justice of the peace from sheer force of habit,
      but by some unexplained freak of popularity the oft-defeated candidate was
      successful by a large majority at the August election.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws-a-massy, boys,&rdquo; he said, tremulously, to his triumphant sons, when
      the result was announced, the excited flush on his thin old face suffusing
      his hollow veinous temples, and rising into his fine white hair, &ldquo;how glad
      Eveliny would hev been ef&mdash;ef&mdash;&rdquo; He was about to say if she had
      lived, for he often spoke of her as if she were dead. He turned suddenly
      back, and began to eagerly absorb the details of the race, as if he had
      often before been elected, with calm superiority canvassing the relative
      strength, or rather the relative weakness, of the defeated aspirants.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely have measured the joy which the news gave to Evelina.
      She was eminently susceptible of the elation of pride, the fervid glow of
      success; but her tender heart melted in sympathetic divination of all that
      this was to him who had sought it so long, and so unabashed by defeat. She
      pined to see his triumph in his eyes, to hear it in his voice. She
      wondered&mdash;nay, she knew that he longed to tell it to her. As the year
      rolled around again to summer, and she heard from time to time of his
      quarterly visits to the town as a member of the worshipful Quarterly
      County Court, she began to hope that, softened by his prosperity, lifted
      so high by his honors above all the cavillings of the Kittredges, he might
      be more leniently disposed toward her, might pity her, might even go so
      far as to forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      But none of her filial messages reached her father's fiery old heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye'll be sure, Abs'lom, ef ye see Joe Boyd in town, ye'll tell him ter
      gin dad my respec's, an' the word ez how the baby air a-thrivin', an' I
      wants ter fotch him ter see the fambly at home, ef they'll lemme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she would watch Absalom with all the confidence of happy
      anticipation, as he rode off down the mountain with his hair flaunting,
      and his spurs jingling, and his shy young horse curveting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no word ever came in response; and sometimes she would take the child
      in her arms and carry him down a path, worn smooth by her own feet, to a
      jagged shoulder thrust out by the mountain where all the slopes fell away,
      and a crag beetled over the depths of the Cove. Thence she could discern
      certain vague lines marking the enclosure, and a tiny cluster of foliage
      hardly recognizable as the orchard, in the midst of which the cabin
      nestled. She could not distinguish them, but she knew that the cows were
      coming to be milked, lowing and clanking their bells tunefully, fording
      the river that had the sunset emblazoned upon it, or standing flank deep
      amidst its ripples; the chickens might be going to roost among the althea
      bushes; the lazy old dogs were astir on the porch. She could picture her
      brothers at work about the barn; most often a white-haired man who walked
      with a stick&mdash;alack! she did not fancy how feebly, nor that his white
      hair had grown long and venerable, and tossed in the breeze. &ldquo;Ef he would
      jes lemme kem fur one haff'n hour!&rdquo; she would cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all her griefs were bewept on the crag, that there might be no tears
      to distress the tenderhearted Absalom when she should return to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The election of Squire Quimbey was a sad blow to the arrogant spirit of
      the Kittredges. They had easily accustomed themselves to ascendency, and
      they hotly resented the fact that fate had forborne the opportunity to hit
      Joel Quimbey when he was down. They had used their utmost influence to
      defeat him in the race, and had openly avowed their desire to see him bite
      the dust. The inimical feeling between the families culminated one rainy
      autumnal day in the town where the quarterly county court was in session.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fire had been kindled in the great rusty stove, and crackled away with
      grudging merriment inside, imparting no sentiment of cheer to the gaunt
      bare room, with its dusty window-panes streaked with rain, its shutters
      drearily flapping in the wind, and the floor bearing the imprint of many
      boots burdened with the red clay of the region. The sound of slow
      strolling feet in the brick-paved hall was monotonous and somnolent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Quimbey sat in his place among the justices. Despite his pride of
      office, he had not the heart for business that might formerly have been
      his. More than once his attention wandered. He looked absently out of the
      nearest window at the neighboring dwelling&mdash;a little frame-house with
      a green yard; a well-sweep was defined against the gray sky, and about the
      curb a file of geese followed with swaying gait the wise old gander. &ldquo;What
      a hand for fow-<i>els</i> Eveliny war!&rdquo; he muttered to himself; &ldquo;an' she
      hed luck with sech critters.&rdquo; He used the obituary tense, for Evelina had
      in some sort passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his hand across his corrugated brow, and suddenly he became
      aware that her husband was in the room, speaking to the chairman of the
      county court, and claiming a certificate in the sum of two dollars each
      for the scalps of one wolf, &ldquo;an' one painter,&rdquo; he continued, laying the
      small furry repulsive objects upon the desk, &ldquo;an' one dollar fur the skelp
      of one wild-cat.&rdquo; He was ready to take his oath that these animals were
      killed by him running at large in this county.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stooped a little in making the transfer. He came suddenly to his
      full height, and stood with one hand in his leather belt, the other
      shouldering his rifle. The old man scanned him curiously. The crude light
      from the long windows was full upon his tall slim figure; his yellow hair
      curled down upon the collar of his blue jeans coat; his great miry boots
      were drawn high over the trousers to the knee; his pensive deer-like eyes
      brightened with a touch of arrogance and enmity as, turning slowly to see
      who was present, his glance encountered his father-in-law's fiery gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cheerman! Mr. Cheerman!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, tremulously, &ldquo;lemme
      examinate that thar wild-cat skelp. Thanky, sir; thanky, sir; I wanter see
      ef hain't off'n the head o' some old tame tomcat. An' this air a painter's
      &ldquo;&mdash;affecting to scan it by the window&mdash;&ldquo;two ears 'cordin' to
      law; yes, sir, two; and this&rdquo;&mdash;his keen old face had all the white
      light of the sad gray day on its bleaching hair and its many lines, and
      his eager old hands trembled with the excitement of the significant satire
      he enacted&mdash;&ldquo;an' this air a wolf's, ye say? Yes; it's a Kittredge's;
      same thing, Mr. Cheerman, by a diff'ent name; nuthin' in the code 'bout'n
      a premium fur a Kittredge's skelp; but same natur'; coward, bully, thief&mdash;<i>thief!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words in the high cracked voice rang from the bare walls and bare
      floors as he tossed the scalps from him, and sat down, laughing silently
      in painful, mirthless fashion, his toothless jaw quivering, and his
      shaking hands groping for the arms of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says a Kittredge air a thief says a lie!&rdquo; cried out the young man,
      recovering from his tense surprise. &ldquo;I don't keer how old he be,&rdquo; he
      stipulated&mdash;for he had not thought to see her father so aged&mdash;&ldquo;he
      lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man fixed him with a steady gaze and a sudden alternation of
      calmness. &ldquo;Ye air a Kittredge; ye stole my daughter from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never. She kem of her own accord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn ye!&rdquo; the old man retorted to the unwelcome truth. There was nothing
      else for him to say. &ldquo;Damn the whole tribe of ye; everything that goes by
      the accursed name of Kittredge, that's got a drop o' yer blood, or a bone
      o' yer bones, or a puif o' yer breath&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squair! squair!&rdquo; interposed an officious old colleague, taking him by the
      elbow, &ldquo;jes' quiet down now; ye air a-cussin' yer own gran'son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be! so be!&rdquo; cried the old man, in a frenzy of rage. &ldquo;Damn 'em all&mdash;all
      the Kittredge tribe!&rdquo; He gasped for breath; his lips still moved
      speechlessly as he fell back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kittredge let his gun slip from his shoulder, the butt ringing heavily as
      it struck upon the floor. &ldquo;I ain't a-goin' ter take sech ez that off'n ye,
      old man,&rdquo; he cried, pallid with fury, for be it remembered this grandson
      was that august institution, a first baby. &ldquo;He sha'n't sit up thar an'
      cuss the baby, Mr. Cheerman.&rdquo; He appealed to the presiding justice,
      holding up his right arm as tremulous as old Quimbey's own. &ldquo;I want the
      law! I ain't a-goin' ter tech a old man like him, an' my wife's father, so
      I ax in the name o' peace fur the law. Don't deny it&rdquo;&mdash;with a warning
      glance&mdash;&ldquo;'kase I ain't school-larned, an' dunno how ter get it. Don't
      ye deny me the law! I <i>know</i> the law don't 'low a magistrate an' a
      jestice ter cuss in his high office, in the presence of the county court.
      I want the law! I want the law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chairman of the court, who had risen in his excitement, turning
      eagerly first to one and then to the other of the speakers, striving to
      silence the colloquy, and in the sudden surprise of it at a momentary loss
      how to take action, sat down abruptly, and with a face of consternation.
      Profanity seemed to him so usual and necessary an incident of conversation
      that it had never occurred to him until this moment that by some strange
      aberration from the rational estimate of essentials it was entered in the
      code as a violation of law. He would fain have overlooked it, but the room
      was crowded with spectators. The chairman would be a candidate for
      re-election as justice of the peace at the expiration of his term. And
      after all what was old Quimbey to him, or he to old Quimbey, that, with
      practically the whole town looking on, he should destroy his political
      prospects and disregard the dignity of his office. He had a certain twinge
      of conscience, and a recollection of the choice and fluent oaths of his
      own repertory, but as he turned over the pages of the code in search of
      the section he deftly argued that they were uttered in his own presence as
      a person, not as a justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so for the first time old Joel Quimbey appeared as a law-breaker, and
      was duly fined by the worshipful county court fifty cents for each oath,
      that being the price at which the State rates the expensive and impious
      luxury of swearing in the hearing of a justice of the peace, and which in
      its discretion the court saw fit to adopt in this instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man offered no remonstrance; he said not a word in his own
      defence. He silently drew out his worn wallet, with much contortion of his
      thin old anatomy in getting to his pocket, and paid his fines on the spot.
      Absalom had already left the room, the clerk having made out the
      certificates, the chairman of the court casting the scalps into the open
      door of the stove, that they might be consumed by fire according to law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young mountaineer wore a heavy frown, and his heart was ill at ease.
      He sought some satisfaction in the evident opinion of the crowd which now
      streamed out, for the excitements within were over, that he had done a
      fine thing; a very clever thought, they considered it, to demand the law
      of Mr. Chairman, that one of their worships should be dragged from the
      bench and arraigned before the quarterly county court of which he was a
      member. The result gave general satisfaction, although there were those
      who found fault with the court's moderation, and complained that the least
      possible cognizance had been taken of the offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo; laughed an old codger in the street. &ldquo;I jes knowed that hurt
      old Joel Quimbey wuss 'n ef a body hed druv a knife through him; he's been
      so proud o' bein' jestice 'mongst his betters, an' bein' 'lected at las',
      many times ez he hev run. Waal, Abs'lom, ye hev proved thar's law fur
      jestices too. I tell ye ye hev got sense in yer skull-i-bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Absalom hung his head before these congratulations; he found no relish
      in the old man's humbled pride. Yet had he not cursed the baby, lumping
      him among the Kittredges? Absalom went about for a time, with a hopeful
      anxiety in his eyes, searching for one of the younger Quim-beys, in order
      to involve him in a fight that might have a provocation and a result more
      to his mind. Somehow the recollection of the quivering and aged figure of
      his wife's father, of the smitten look on his old face, of his abashed and
      humbled demeanor before the court, was a reproach to him, vivid and
      continuously present with his repetitious thoughts forever re-enacting the
      scene. His hands trembled; he wanted to lay hold on a younger man, to
      replace this aesthetic revenge with a quarrel more wholesome in the
      estimation of his own conscience. But the Quimbey sons were not in town
      to-day. He could only stroll about and hear himself praised for this thing
      that he had done, and wonder how he should meet Evelina with his
      conscience thus arrayed against himself for her father's sake. &ldquo;Plumb
      turned Quimbey, I swear,&rdquo; he said, in helpless reproach to this
      independent and coercive moral force within. His dejection, he supposed,
      had reached its lowest limits, when a rumor pervaded the town, so wild
      that he thought it could be only fantasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It proved to be fact. Joel Quimbey, aggrieved, humbled, and indignant, had
      resigned his office, and as Absalom rode out of town toward the mountains,
      he saw the old man in his crumpled brown jeans suit, mounted on his white
      mare, jogging down the red clay road, his head bowed before the slanting
      lines of rain, on his way to his cheerless fireside. He turned off
      presently, for the road to the levels of the Cove was not the shorter cut
      that Absalom travelled to the mountains. But all the way the young man
      fancied that he saw from time to time, as the bridle-path curved in the
      intricacies of the laurel, the bowed old figure among the mists, jogging
      along, his proud head and his stiff neck bent to the slanting rain and the
      buffets of his unkind fate. And yet, pressing the young horse to overtake
      him, Absalom could find naught but the fleecy mists drifting down the
      bridle-path as the wind might will, or lurking in the darkling nooks of
      the laurel when the wind would.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The sun was shining on the mountains, and Absalom went up from the sad
      gray rain and through the gloomy clouds of autumn hanging over the Cove
      into a soft brilliant upper atmosphere&mdash;a generous after-thought of
      summer&mdash;and the warm brightness of Evelina's smile. She stood in the
      doorway as she saw him dismounting, with her finger on her lips, for the
      baby was sleeping: he put much of his time into that occupation. The tiny
      gourds hung yellow among the vines that clambered over the roof of the
      porch, and a brave jack-bean&mdash;a friend of the sheltering eaves&mdash;made
      shift to bloom purple and white, though others of the kind hung, crisp and
      sere, and rattled their dry bones in every gust. The &ldquo;gyarden spot&rdquo; at the
      side of the house was full of brown and withered skeletons of the summer
      growths; among the crisp blades of the Indian-corn a sibilant voice was
      forever whispering; down the tawny-colored vistas the pumpkins glowed. The
      sky was blue; the yellow hickory flaming against it and hanging over the
      roof of the cabin was a fine color to see. The red sour-wood tree in the
      fence corner shook out a myriad of white tassels; the rolling tumult of
      the gray clouds below thickened, and he could hear the rain a-falling&mdash;falling
      into the dreary depths of the Cove.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this for him: why should he disquiet himself for the storm that burst
      upon others?
    </p>
    <p>
      Evelina seemed a part of the brightness; her dark eyes so softly alight,
      her curving red lips, the faint flush in her cheeks, her rich brown hair,
      and the purplish kerchief about the neck of her yellow dress. Once more
      she looked smilingly at him, and shook her head and laid her finger on her
      lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I oughter been sati'fied with all I got, stiddier hectorin' other folks
      till they 'ain't got no heart ter hold on ter what they been at sech
      trouble ter git,&rdquo; he said, as he turned out the horse and strode gloomily
      toward the house with the saddle over his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hev ennybody been spiteful ter you-uns ter-day?&rdquo; she asked, in an almost
      maternal solicitude, and with a flash of partisan anger in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git out'n my road, Eveliny,&rdquo; he said, fretfully, pushing by, and throwing
      the saddle on the floor. There was no one in the room but the occupant of
      the rude box on rockers which served as cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absalom had a swift, prescient fear. &ldquo;She'll git it all out'n me ef I
      don't look sharp,&rdquo; he said to himself. Then aloud, &ldquo;Whar's mam?&rdquo; he
      demanded, flinging himself into a chair and looking loweringly about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Topknot hev jes kem off'n her nest with fourteen deedies, an' she an'
      'Melia hev gone ter the barn ter see 'bout'n 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar's Pete?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-huntin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause. The fire smouldered audibly; a hickory-nut fell with a sharp
      thwack on the clapboards of the roof, and rolled down and bounded to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly: &ldquo;I seen yer dad ter-day,&rdquo; he began, without coercion. &ldquo;He gin me
      a cussin', in the courtroom, 'fore all the folks. He cussed all the
      Kit-tredges, <i>all</i> o' 'em; him too&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced in the direction
      of the cradle&mdash;&ldquo;cussed 'em black an' blue, an' called me a <i>thief</i>
      fur marryin' ye an kerry-in' ye off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face turned scarlet, then pale. She sat down, her trembling hands
      reaching out to rock the cradle, as if the youthful Kittredge might be
      disturbed by the malediction hurled upon his tribe. But he slept sturdily
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, now,&rdquo; she said, making a great effort at self-control, &ldquo;ye oughtn't
      ter mind it. Ye know he war powerful tried. I never purtended ter be ez
      sweet an' pritty ez the baby air, but how would you-uns feel ef somebody
      ye despised war ter kem hyar an' tote him off from we-uns forever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd cut thar hearts out,&rdquo; he said, with prompt barbarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar, now!&rdquo; exclaimed his wife, in triumphant logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gloomily eyed the smouldering coals. He was beginning to understand the
      paternal sentiment. By his own heart he was learning the heart of his
      wife's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd chop 'em inter minch-meat,&rdquo; he continued, carrying his just reprisals
      a step further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, don't do it right now,&rdquo; said his wife, trying to laugh, yet vaguely
      frightened by his vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eveliny,&rdquo; he cried, springing to his feet, &ldquo;I be a-goin' ter tell ye all
      'bout'n it. I jes called on the cheerman fur the law agin him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agin <i>dad!</i>&mdash;the law!&rdquo;' Her voice dropped as she contemplated
      aghast this terrible unapprehended force brought to oppress old Joel
      Quim-bey; she felt a sudden poignant pang for his forlorn and lonely
      estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, never mind, Eveliny,&rdquo; Absalom said, hastily, repenting of his
      frantic candor and seeking to soothe her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>will</i> mind,&rdquo; she said, sternly. &ldquo;What hev ye done ter dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nuthin',&rdquo; he replied, sulkily&mdash;&ldquo;nuthin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye needn't try ter fool me, Abs'lom Kittredge. Ef ye ain't minded ter
      tell me, I'll foot it down ter town an' find out. What did the law do ter
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jes fined him,&rdquo; he said, striving to make light of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' ye done that fur&mdash;<i>spite!</i>&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;A-set-tin' the law
      ter chouse a old man out'n money, fur gittin' mad an' sayin' ye stole his
      only darter. Oh, I'll answer fur him&rdquo;&mdash;she too had risen; her hand
      trembled on the back of the chair, but her face was scornfully smiling&mdash;&ldquo;he
      don't mind the <i>money</i>; he'll never git you-uns <i>fined</i> ter pay
      back the gredge. He don't take his wrath out on folkses' <i>wallets</i>;
      he grips thar throats, or teches the trigger o' his rifle. Laws-a-massy!
      takin' out yer gredge that-a-way! It's ye poorer fur them dollars, Abs'lom&mdash;'tain't
      him.&rdquo; She laughed satirically, and turned to rock the cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'ye want me ter do? Fight a old man?&rdquo; he exclaimed, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept silence, only looking at him with a flushed cheek and a scornful
      laughing eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on, resentfully: &ldquo;I ain't 'shamed,&rdquo; he stoutly asserted. &ldquo;Nobody
      'lowed I oughter be, It's him, plumb bowed down with shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shoe's on the t'other foot,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It's ye that oughter be
      'shamed, an' ef ye ain't, it's more shame ter ye. What hev he got ter be
      'shamed of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Kase,&rdquo; he retorted, &ldquo;he war fetched up afore a court on a crim'nal
      offence&mdash;a-cussin' afore the court! Ye may think it's no shame, but
      he do; he war so 'shamed he gin up his office ez jestice o' the peace,
      what he hev run fur four or five times, an' always got beat 'ceptin'
      wunst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; but for the whisper she seemed turning to stone; her dilated eyes
      were fixed as she stared into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I seen him a-ridin' off from town in the rain arterward, his head
      hangin' plumb down ter the saddle-bow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her amazed eyes were still fastened upon his face, but her hand no longer
      trembled on the back of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly held out his own hand to her, his sympathy and regret
      returning as he recalled the picture of the lonely wayfarer in the rain
      that had touched him so. &ldquo;Oh, Eveliny!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I never war so beset
      an' sorry an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She struck his hand down; her eyes blazed. Her aspect was all instinct
      with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do declar' I'll never furgive ye&mdash;ter spite him so&mdash;an' kem
      an' tell <i>me!</i> An' shame him so ez he can't hold his place&mdash;an'
      kem an' tell <i>me!</i> An' bow him down so ez he can't show his face whar
      he hev been so respected by all&mdash;an' kem an' tell <i>me!</i> An' all
      fur spite, fur he hev got nuthin' ye want now. An' I gin him up an' lef
      him lonely, an' all fur you-uns. Ye air mean, Abs'lom Kit-tredge, an' I'm
      the mos' fursaken fool on the face o' the yearth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to speak, but she held up her hand in expostulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nare word&mdash;fur I won't answer. I do declar' I'll never speak ter ye
      agin ez long ez I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flung away with a laugh and a jeer. &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; he said,
      encouragingly; &ldquo;plenty o' men would be powerful glad ef thar wives would
      take pattern by that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught up his hat and strode out of the room. He busied himself in
      stabling his horse, and in looking after the stock. He could hear the
      women's voices from the loft of the barn as they disputed about the best
      methods of tending the newly hatched chickens, that had chipped the shell
      so late in the fall as to be embarrassed by the frosts and the coming cold
      weather. The last bee had ceased to drone about the great crimson
      prince's-feather by the door-step, worn purplish through long flaunting,
      and gone to seed. The clouds were creeping up and up the slope, and others
      were journeying hither from over the mountains. A sense of moisture was in
      the air, although a great column of dust sprang up from the dry
      corn-field, with panic-stricken suggestions, and went whirling away,
      carrying off withered blades in the rush. The first drops of rain were
      pattering, with a resonant timbre in the midst, when Pete came home with a
      newly killed deer on his horse, and the women, with fluttering skirts and
      sun-bonnets, ran swiftly across from the barn to the back door of the
      shed-room. Then the heavy downpour made the cabin rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Eveliny an' the baby oughtn't ter be out in this hyar rain&mdash;they'll
      be drenched,&rdquo; said the old woman, when they were all safely housed except
      the two. &ldquo;Whar be she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-foolin' in the gyarden spot a-getherin' seed an' sech, like she always
      be,&rdquo; said the sister-in-law, tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absalom ran out into the rain without his hat, his heart in the clutch of
      a prescient terror. No; the summer was over for the garden as well as for
      him; all forlorn and rifled, its few swaying shrubs tossed wildly about, a
      mockery of the grace and bloom that had once embellished it. His wet hair
      Streaming backward in the wind caught on the laurel boughs as he went down
      and down the tangled path that her homesick feet had worn to the crag
      which overlooked the Cove. Not there! He stood, himself enveloped in the
      mist, and gazed blankly into the folds of the dun-colored clouds that with
      tumultuous involutions surged above the valley and baffled his vision. He
      realized it with a sinking heart. She was gone.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      That afternoon&mdash;it was close upon nightfall&mdash;Stephen Quimbey,
      letting down the bars for the cows, noticed through the slanting lines of
      rain, serried against the masses of sober-hued vapors which hid the great
      mountain towering above the Cove, a woman crossing the foot-bridge. He
      turned and lifted down another bar, and then looked again. Something was
      familiar in her aspect, certainly. He stood gravely staring. Her
      sun-bonnet had fallen back upon her shoulders, and was hanging loosely
      there by the strings tied beneath her chin; her brown hair, dishevelled'
      by the storm, tossed back and forth in heavy wave-less locks, wet through
      and through. When the wind freshened they lashed, thong-like, her pallid
      oval face; more than once she put up her hand and tried to gather them
      together, or to press them back&mdash;only one hand, for she clasped a
      heavy bundle in her arms, and as she toiled along slowly up the rocky
      slope, Stephen suddenly held his palm above his eyes. The recognition was
      becoming definite, and yet he could scarcely believe his senses: was it
      indeed Evelina, wind-tossed, tempest-beaten, and with as many tears as
      rain-drops on her pale cheek? Evelina, forlorn and sorry, and with swollen
      sad dark eyes, and listless exhausted step&mdash;here again at the bars,
      where she had not stood since she dragged her wounded lover thence on-that
      eventful night two years and more ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resentment for the domestic treachery was uppermost in his mind, and he
      demanded surlily, when she had advanced within the sound of his words,
      &ldquo;What hev ye kem hyar fur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ter stay,&rdquo; she responded, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand in an uncertain gesture laid hold upon his tuft of beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fur good?&rdquo; he faltered, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped to lift down the lowest bar that she might pass. Suddenly the
      bundle she clasped gave a dexterous twist; a small head, with yellow downy
      hair, was thrust forth; a pair of fawn-like eyes fixed an inquiring stare
      upon him; the pink face distended with a grin, to which the two small
      teeth in the red mouth, otherwise empty, lent a singularly merry
      expression; and with a manner that was a challenge to pursuit, the head
      disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared, tucked with affected shyness
      under Evelina's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left Stephen standing with the bar in his hand, staring blankly after
      her, and ran into the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father had no questions to ask&mdash;nor she.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he caught her in his arms he gave a great cry of joy that rang through
      the house, and brought Timothy from the barn, in astonishment, to the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eveliny's <i>home!</i>&rdquo; he cried out to Tim, who, with the ox-yoke in his
      hand, paused in the doorway. &ldquo;Kem ter stay! Eveliny's <i>home!</i> I
      knowed she'd kem back to her old daddy. Eveliny's kem ter stay fur good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tole me they'd hectored ye plumb out'n the town an' out'n yer
      office. They hed the insurance ter tell <i>me</i> that word!&rdquo; she cried,
      sobbing on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'ye reckon I keer fur enny jestice's cheer when I hev got ye agin
      ter set alongside o' me by the fire?&rdquo; he exclaimed, his cracked old voice
      shrill with triumphant gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed her into her rocking-chair in the chimney-corner, and laughed
      again with the supreme pleasure of the moment, although she had leaned her
      head against the logs of the wall, and was sobbing aloud with the
      contending emotions that tore her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't ye ever want ter kem afore, Eveliny?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I hev been
      a-pinin' fur a glimge o' ye.&rdquo; He was in his own place now, his hands
      trembling as they lay on the arms of his chair; a pathetic reproach was in
      his voice. &ldquo;Though old folks oughtn't ter expec' too much o' young ones,
      ez be all tuk up naterally with tharse'fs,&rdquo; he added, bravely. He would
      not let his past lonely griefs mar the bright present. &ldquo;Old folks air
      mos'ly cumber-ers&mdash;mos'ly cumberers o' the yearth, ennyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her weeping had ceased; she was looking at him with dismayed surprise in
      her eyes, still lustrous with unshed tears. &ldquo;Why, dad I sent ye a hundred
      messages ef I mought kem. I tole Abs'lom ter tell Joe Boyd&mdash;bein' as
      ye liked Joe&mdash;I wanted ter see ye.&rdquo; She leaned forward and looked up
      at him with frowning intensity. &ldquo;They never gin ye that word?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed aloud in sorry scorn. &ldquo;We can't teach our chil'n nuthin',&rdquo; he
      philosophized. &ldquo;They hev got ter hurt tharse'fs with all the thorns an'
      the stings o' the yearth. Our sperience with the sharp things an' bitter
      ones don't do them no sarvice. Naw, leetle darter&mdash;naw! Ye mought ez
      well gin a message o' kindness ter a wolf, an' expec' him ter kerry it ter
      some lonesome, helpless thing a-wounded by the way-side, ez gin it ter a
      Kittredge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never will speak ter one o' 'em agin ez long ez I live,&rdquo; she cried,
      with a fresh gust of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, reassuringly, and chirping high, &ldquo;hyar we
      all be agin, jes' the same ez we war afore. Don't cry, Eveliny; it's jes'
      the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden babbling intruded upon the conversation. The youthful Kittredge,
      as he sat upon the wide flat stones of the hearth, was as unwelcome here
      in the Cove as a Quimbey had been in the cabin on the mountain. The great
      hickory fire called for his unmixed approval, coming in, as he had done,
      from the gray wet day. He shuffled his bare pink feet&mdash;exceedingly
      elastic and agile members they seemed to be, and he had a remarkable
      &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; upon their use&mdash;and brought them smartly down upon their
      heels as if this were one of the accepted gestures of applause. Then he
      looked up at the dark frowning faces of his mother's brothers, and gurgled
      with laughter, showing the fascinating spectacle of his two front teeth.
      Perhaps it was the only Kittredge eye that they were not willing to meet.
      They solemnly gazed beyond him and into the fire, ignoring his very
      existence. He sustained the slight with an admirable cheerfulness, and
      babbled and sputtered and flounced about with his hands. He grew pinker in
      the generous firelight, and he looked very fat as he sat in a heap on the
      floor. He seemed to have threads tightly tied about his bolster-shaped
      limbs in places where elder people prefer joints&mdash;in his ankles and
      wrists and elbows&mdash;for his arms were bare, and although his frock of
      pink calico hung decorously high on one shoulder, it drooped quite off
      from the other, showing a sturdy chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother took slight notice of him; she was beginning to look about the
      room with a certain critical disfavor at the different arrangement of the
      household furniture adopted by her father's deaf and widowed old sister
      who presided here now, and who, it chanced, had been called away by the
      illness of a relative. Evelina got up presently, and shifted the position
      of the spinning-wheels, placing the flax-wheel where the large wheel had
      been. She then pushed out the table from the corner. &ldquo;What ailed her ter
      sot it hyar?&rdquo; she grumbled, in a disaffected undertone, and shoved it to
      the centre of the floor, where it had always stood during her own sway.
      She cast a discerning glance up among the strings of herbs and peppers
      hanging from above, and examined the shelves where the simple stores for
      table use were arranged in earthen-ware bowls or gourds&mdash;all with an
      air of vague dissatisfaction. She presently stepped into the shed-room,
      and there looked over the piles of quilts. They were in order, certainly,
      but placed in a different method from her own; another woman's hand had
      been at work, and she was jealous of its very touch among these familiar
      old things to which she seemed positively akin. &ldquo;I wonder how I made out
      ter bide so long on the mounting,&rdquo; she said; and with the recollection of
      the long-haired Absalom there was another gush of tears and sobs, which
      she stifled as she could in one of the old quilts that held many of her
      own stitches and was soothing to touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infantile Kittredge, who was evidently not born to blush unseen,
      seemed to realize that he had failed to attract the attention of the three
      absorbed Quimbeys who sat about the fire. He blithely addressed himself to
      another effort. He suddenly whisked himself over on all-fours, and with a
      certain ursine aspect went nimbly across the hearth, still holding up his
      downy yellow head, his pink face agrin, and alluringly displaying his two
      facetious teeth. He caught the rung of Tim's chair, and lifted himself
      tremulously to an upright posture. And then it became evident that he was
      about to give an exhibition of the thrilling feat of walking around a
      chair. With a truly Kittredge perversity he had selected the one that had
      the savage Timothy seated in it. For an instant the dark-browed face
      scowled down into his unaffrighted eyes: it seemed as if Tim might kick
      him into the fire. The next moment he had set out to circumnavigate, as it
      were. What a prodigious force he expended upon it! How he gurgled and
      grinned and twisted his head to observe the effect upon the men, all
      sedulously gazing into the fire! how he bounced, and anon how he sank with
      sudden genuflections! how limber his feet seemed, and what free agents!
      Surely he never intended to put them down at that extravagant angle. More
      than once one foot was placed on top of the other&mdash;an attitude that
      impeded locomotion and resulted in his sitting down in an involuntary
      manner and with some emphasis. With an appalling temerity he clutched
      Tim's great miry boots to help him up and on his way round. Occasionally
      he swayed to and fro, with his teeth on exhibition, laughing and babbling
      and shrilly exclaiming, inarticulately bragging of his agile prowess, as
      if he were able to defy all the Quimbeys, who would not notice him. And
      when it was all over he went in his wriggling ursine gait back to the
      hearth-stone, and there he was sitting, demurely enough, and as if he had
      never moved, when his mother returned and found him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no indication that he had attracted a moment's attention. She
      looked gravely down at him; then took her chair. A pair of blue yarn socks
      was in her hand. &ldquo;I never see sech darnin' ez Aunt Sairy Ann do fur ye,
      dad; I hev jes tuk my shears an' cut this heel smang out, an' I be goin'
      ter do it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped a tiny gourd into the heel, and began to draw the slow threads
      to and fro across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blaze, red and yellow, and with elusive purple gleams, leaped up the
      chimney. The sap was still in the wood; it sang a summer-tide song. But an
      autumn wind was blowing shrilly down the chimney; one could hear the
      sibilant rush of the dead leaves on the blast. The window and the door
      shook, and were still, and once more rattled as if a hand were on the
      latch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;Ever weigh him?&rdquo; her father asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat upright with a nervous start. It was a moment before she
      understood that it was of the Kittredge scion he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his high cracked laugh the old man leaned over, his outspread hand
      hovering about the plump baby, uncertain where, in so much soft fatness,
      it might be practicable to clutch him. There were some large horn buttons
      on the back of his frock, a half-dozen of which, gathered together,
      afforded a grasp. He lifted the child by them, laughing in undisguised
      pleasure to feel the substantial strain upon the garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toler'ble survigrus,&rdquo; he declared, with his high chirp.
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter suddenly sprang up with a pallid face and a pointing hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The winder!&rdquo; she huskily cried&mdash;&ldquo;suthin's at the winder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when they looked they saw only the dark square of tiny panes, with the
      fireside scene genially reflected on it. And then she fell to declaring
      that she had been dreaming, and besought them not to take down their guns
      nor to search, and would not be still until they had all seemed to concede
      the point; it was she who fastened the doors and shutters, and she did not
      lie down to rest till they were all asleep and hours had passed. None of
      them doubted that it was Absalom's face that she had seen at the window,
      where the light had once lured him before, and she knew that she had
      dreamed no dream like this.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      It soon became evident that whenever Joe Boyd was intrusted with a message
      he would find means to deliver it. For upon him presently devolved the
      difficult duties of ambassador. The first time that his honest square face
      appeared at the rail fence, and the sound of his voice roused Evelina as
      she stood feeding the poultry close by, she returned his question with a
      counter-question hard to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev been up the mounting,&rdquo; he said, smiling, as he hooked his arms over
      the rail fence. &ldquo;Abs'-lom he say he wanter know when ye'll git yer visit
      out an' kem home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned her elbow against the ash-hopper, balancing the wooden bowl of
      corn-meal batter on its edge and trembling a little; the geese and
      chickens and turkeys crowded, a noisy rout, about her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; she said, irrelevantly, &ldquo;ye air one o' the few men on this yearth
      ez ain't a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her gravely for a moment, then burst into a forced laugh.
      &ldquo;Ho! ho! I tell a bushel o' 'em a day, Eveliny!&rdquo; He wagged his head in an
      anxious affectation of mirth.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why'n't ye gin dad them messages ez Abs'lom gin ye from me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe received this in blank amaze; then, with sudden comprehension, his
      lower jaw dropped. He looked at her with a plea for pity in his eyes. And
      yet his ready tact strove to reassert itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mus' hev furgot 'em,&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Abs'lom ever gin 'em ter ye?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ef he did</i>, I mus' hev furgot 'em,&rdquo; he repeated, crestfallen and
      hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and turned jauntily away, once more throwing the corn-meal
      batter to the greedily jostling poultry. &ldquo;Tell Abs'lom I hev fund him
      out,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He can't sot me agin dad no sech way. This be my home,
      an' hyar I be goin' ter 'bide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so she left the good Joe Boyd hooked on by the elbows to the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Quimbeys, who had heard this conversation from within, derived from it
      no small elation. &ldquo;She hev gin 'em the go-by fur good,&rdquo; Timothy said,
      confidently, to his father, who laughed in triumph, and pulled calmly at
      his pipe, and looked ten years younger.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Steve was surlily anxious. &ldquo;I'd place heap mo' dependence in Eveliny
      ef she didn't hev this hyar way o' cryin' all the time. She 'lows she's
      glad she kem&mdash;<i>so glad</i> she hev lef Abs'lom fur good an' all&mdash;an'
      then she busts out a-cryin' agin. I ain't able ter argufy on sech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! wimmen air always a-cryin', an' they don't mean <i>nuthin''</i> by
      it,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, in the plenitude of his wisdom. &ldquo;It air jes'
      one o' thar most contrarious ways. I hev seen 'em set down an' cry fur joy
      an' pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Steve was doubtful. &ldquo;It be a powerful low-sperited gift fur them ez
      hev ter 'bide along of 'em. Eveliny never useter be tearful in nowise. Now
      she cries a heap mo' 'n that thar shoat&rdquo;&mdash;his lips curled in contempt
      as he glanced toward the door, through which was visible a small rotund
      figure in pink calico, seated upon the lowest log of the wood-pile&mdash;&ldquo;ez
      she fotched down hyar with her. <i>He</i> never hev hed a reg'lar blate
      but two or three times sence he hev been hyar, an' them war when that thar
      old tur-rkey gobbler teetered up ter him an' tuk his corn-dodger that he
      war a-eatin' on plumb out'n his hand. <i>He</i> hed suthin' to holler fur&mdash;hed
      los' his breakfus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't he 'pear ter you-uns to be powerful peeg-eon-toed?&rdquo; asked Tim,
      anxiously, turning to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gawbbler?&rdquo; faltered the amazed old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw; him, <i>him&mdash;Kittredge</i>,&rdquo; said Tim, jerking his big thumb in
      the direction of the small boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law-dy Gawd A'mighty! <i>naw! naw!</i>&rdquo; The grandfather indignantly
      repudiated the imputation of the infirmity. One would have imagined that
      he would deem it meet that a Kittredge should be pigeon-toed. &ldquo;It's jes
      the way <i>all</i> babies hev got a-walkin'; he ain't right handy yit with
      his feet&mdash;jes a-beginnin' ter walk, an' sech. Peegeon-toed! I say it,
      ye fool!&rdquo; He cast a glance of contempt on his eldest-born, and arrogantly
      puffed his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Joe Boyd came, and yet again. He brought messages contrite and
      promissory from Absalom; he brought commands stern and insistent. He came
      into the house at last, and sat and talked at the fireside in the presence
      of the men of the family, who bore themselves in a manner calculated to
      impress the Kittredge emissary with their triumph and contempt for his
      mission, although they studiously kept silence, leaving it to Evelina to
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the old man, leaning forward, tapped Joe on the knee. &ldquo;See hyar,
      Joe. Ye hev always been a good frien' o' mine. This hyar man he stole my
      darter from me, an' whenst she wanted ter be frien's, an' not let her old
      dad die unforgiving he wouldn't let her send the word ter me. An' then he
      sot himself ter spite an' hector me, an' fairly run me out'n the town, an'
      harried me out'n my office; an' when she fund out&mdash;she wouldn't take
      my word fur it&mdash;the deceivin' natur' o' the Kittredge tribe, she hed
      hed enough o' 'em. I hev let ye argufy 'bout'n it; ye hev hed yer fill of
      words. An' now I be tired out. Ye ain't 'lowin' she'll ever go back ter
      her husband, air ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe dolorously shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, ef ever ye kem hyar talkin' 'bout'n it agin, I'll be 'bleeged ter
      take down my rifle ter ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe gazed, unmoved, into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that would be mighty hard on me, Joe, 'kase ye be so pop'lar 'mongst
      all, I dunno <i>what</i> the kentry-side would do ter me ef I war ter put
      a bullet inter ye. Ye air a young man, Joe. Ye oughter spare a old man
      sech a danger ez that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened that Joe Boyd's offices as mediator ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week went by in silence and without result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evelina's tears seemed to keep count of the minutes. The brothers
      indignantly noted it, and even the old man was roused from the placid
      securities of his theories concerning lachrymose womankind, and
      remonstrated sometimes, and sometimes grew angry and exhorted her to go
      back. What did it matter to her how her father was treated? He was a
      cumberer of the ground, and many people besides her husband had thought he
      had no right to sit in a justice's chair. And then she would burst into
      tears once more, and declare again that she would never go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thoroughly cheerful soul about the place was the intruding
      Kittredge. He sat continuously&mdash;for the weather was fine&mdash;on the
      lowest log of the wood-pile, and swung his bare pink feet among the chips
      and bark, and seemed to have given up all ambition to walk. Occasionally
      red and yellow leaves whisked past his astonished eyes, although these
      were few now, for November was on the wane. He babbled to the chickens,
      who pecked about him with as much indifference as if he were made of wood.
      His two teeth came glittering out whenever the rooster crowed, and his
      gleeful laugh&mdash;he rejoiced so in this handsomely endowed bird&mdash;could
      be heard to the barn. The dogs seemed never to have known that he was a
      Kittredge, and wagged their tails at the very sound of his voice, and
      seized surreptitious opportunities to lick his face. Of all his underfoot
      world only the gobbler awed him into gravity and silence; he would gaze in
      dismay as the marauding fowl irresolutely approached from around the wood
      pile, with long neck out-stretched and undulating gait, applying first one
      eye and then the other to the pink hands, for the gobbler seemed to
      consider them a perpetual repository of corn-dodgers, which indeed they
      were. Then the head and the wabbling red wattles would dart forth with a
      sudden peck, and the shriek that ensued proved that nothing could be much
      amiss with the Kittredge lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine day he sat thus in the red November sunset. The sky, seen through
      the interlacing black boughs above his head, was all amber and crimson,
      save for a wide space of pure and pallid green, against which the
      purplish-garnet wintry mountains darkly gloomed. Beyond the rail fence the
      avenues of the bare woods were carpeted with the sere yellowish leaves
      that gave back the sunlight with a responsive illuminating effect, and
      thus the sylvan visitas glowed. The long slanting beams elongated his
      squatty little shadow till it was hardly a caricature. He heard the cow
      lowing as she came to be milked, fording the river where the clouds were
      so splendidly reflected. The chickens were going to roost. The odor of the
      wood, the newly-hewn chips, imparted a fresh and fragrant aroma to the
      air. He had found among them a sweet-gum ball and a pine cone, and was
      applying them to the invariable test of taste. Suddenly he dropped them
      with a nervous start, his lips trembled, his lower jaw fell, he was aware
      of a stealthy approach. Something was creeping behind the wood-pile. He
      hardly had time to bethink himself of his enemy the gobbler when he was
      clutched under the arm, swung through the air with a swiftness that caused
      the scream to evaporate in his throat, and the next moment he looked
      quakingly up into his father's face with unrecognizing eyes; for he had
      forgotten Absalom in these few weeks. He squirmed and wriggled as he was
      held on the pommel of the saddle, winking and catching his breath and
      spluttering, as preliminary proceedings to an outcry. There was a sudden
      sound of heavily shod feet running across the puncheon floor within, a
      wild, incoherent exclamation smote the air, an interval of significant
      silence ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; cried Absalom, not waiting for Tim's rifle, but spurring the
      young horse, and putting him at the fence. The animal rose with the
      elasticity and lightness of an uprearing ocean wave. The baby once more
      twisted his soft neck, and looked anxiously into the rider's face. This
      was not the gobbler. The gobbler did not ride horseback. Then the affinity
      of the male infant for the noble equine animal suddenly overbore all else.
      In elation he smote with his soft pink hand the glossy arched neck before
      him. &ldquo;Dul-lup!&rdquo; he arrogantly echoed Absalom's words. And thus father and
      son at a single bound disappeared into woods, and so out of sight.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The savage Tim was leaning upon his rifle in the doorway, his eyes
      dilated, his breath short, his whole frame trembling with excitement, as
      the other men, alarmed by Evelina's screams, rushed down from the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ails ye, Tim? Why'n't ye fire?&rdquo; demanded his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim turned an agitated, baffled look upon him. &ldquo;I&mdash;I mought hev hit
      the baby,&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't ye got no aim, ye durned sinner?&rdquo; asked Stephen, furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bullet mought hev gone through him and struck inter the baby,&rdquo;
       expostulated Tim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' then agin it moughtn't!&rdquo; cried Stephen. &ldquo;Lawd, ef <i>I</i> hed hed
      the chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye wouldn't hev done no differ,&rdquo; declared Tim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hyar!&rdquo; Steve caught his brother's gun and presented it to Tim's lips.
      &ldquo;Suck the bar'l. It's 'bout all ye air good fur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horses had been turned out. By the time they were caught and saddled
      pursuit was evidently hopeless. The men strode in one by one, dashing the
      saddles and bridles on the floor, and finding in angry expletives a vent
      for their grief. And indeed it might have seemed that the Quimbeys must
      have long sought a choice Kittredge infant for adoption, so far did their
      bewailings discount Rachel's mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't cry, Eveliny,&rdquo; they said, ever and anon. &ldquo;We-uns 'll git him back
      fur ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she had not shed a tear. She sat speechless, motionless, as if turned
      to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laws-a-massy, child, ef ye would jes hev b'lieved <i>me</i> 'bout'n them
      Kittredges&mdash;Abs'lom in partic'lar&mdash;ye'd be happy an' free now,&rdquo;
       said the old man, his imagination somewhat extending his experience, for
      he had had no knowledge of his son-in-law until their relationship began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening wore drearily on. Now and then the men roused themselves, and
      with lowering faces discussed the opportunities of reprisal, and the best
      means of rescuing the child. And whether they schemed to burn the
      Kittredge cabin, or to arm themselves, burst in upon their enemies,
      shooting and killing all who resisted, Evelina said nothing, but stared
      into the fire with unnaturally dilated eyes, her white lined face all
      drawn and somehow unrecognizable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; her father said at intervals, taking her cold hand, &ldquo;we-uns
      'll git him back, Eveliny. The Lord hed a mother wunst, an' I'll be bound
      He keeps a special pity for a woman an' her child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, great gosh! who'd hev dreamt we'd hev missed him so!&rdquo; cried Tim,
      shifting his position, and slipping his left arm over the back of his
      chair. &ldquo;Jes ter think o' the leetle size o' him, an' the great big gap he
      hev lef roun' this hyar ha'th-stone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' yit he jes sot underfoot, 'mongst the cat an' the dogs, jes ez
      humble!&rdquo; said Stephen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd git him back even ef he warn't no kin ter me, Eveliny,&rdquo; declared Tim,
      and he spoke advisedly, remembering that the youth was a Kittredge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Evelina said not a word. All that night she silently walked the
      puncheon floor, while the rest of the household slept. The dogs, in vague
      disturbance, because of the unprecedented vigil and stir in the midnight,
      wheezed uneasily from time to time, and crept restlessly about under the
      cabin, now and again thumping their backs or heads against the floor; but
      at last they betook themselves to slumber. The hickory logs broke in twain
      as they burned, and fell on either side, and presently there was only the
      dull red glow of the embers on her pale face, and the room was full of
      brown shadows, motionless, now that the flames flared no more. Once when
      the red glow, growing ever dimmer, seemed almost submerged beneath the
      gray ashes, she paused and stirred the coals. The renewed glimmer showed a
      fixed expression in her eyes, becoming momently more resolute. At
      intervals she knelt at the window and placed her hands about her face to
      shut out the light from the hearth, and looked out upon the night. How the
      chill stars loitered! How the dawn delayed! The great mountain gloomed
      darkling above the Cove. The waning moon, all melancholy and mystic, swung
      in the purple sky. The bare, stark boughs of the trees gave out here and
      there a glimmer of hoar-frost. There was no wind; when she heard the dry
      leaves whisk she caught a sudden glimpse of a fox that, with his crafty
      shadow pursuing him, leaped upon the wood-pile, nimbly ran along its
      length, and so, noiselessly, away&mdash;while the dogs snored beneath the
      house. A cock crew from the chicken-roost; the mountain echoed the
      resonant strain. She saw a mist come stealing softly along a precipitous
      gorge; the gauzy web hung shimmering in the moon; presently the trees were
      invisible; anon they showed rigid among the soft enmeshment of the vapor,
      and again were lost to view..
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose; there was a new energy in her step; she walked quickly across
      the floor and unbarred the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little cabin on the mountain was lost among the clouds. It was not yet
      day, but the old woman, with that proclivity to early rising
      characteristic of advancing years, was already astir. It was in the
      principal room of the cabin that she slept, and it contained another bed,
      in which, placed crosswise, were five billet-shaped objects under the
      quilts, which when awake identified themselves as Peter Kittredge's
      children. She had dressed and uncovered the embers, and put on a few of
      the chips which had been spread out on the hearth to dry, and had sat down
      in the chimney corner. A timid blaze began to steal up, and again was
      quenched, and only the smoke ascended in its form; then the light
      flickered out once more, casting a gigantic shadow of her sun-bonnet&mdash;for
      she had donned it thus early&mdash;half upon the brown and yellow daubed
      wall, and half upon the dark ceiling, making a specious stir amidst the
      peltry and strings of pop-corn hanging motionless thence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed heavily once or twice, and with an aged manner, and leaned her
      elbows on her knees and gazed contemplatively at the fire. All at once the
      ashes were whisked about the hearth as in a sudden draught, and then were
      still. In momentary surprise she pushed her chair back, hesitated, then
      replaced it, and calmly settled again her elbows on her knees. Suddenly
      once more a whisking of the ashes; a cold shiver ran through her, and she
      turned to see a hand fumbling at the batten shutter close by. She stared
      for a moment as if paralyzed; her spectacles fell to the floor from her
      nerveless hand, shattering the lenses on the hearth. She rose trembling to
      her feet, and her lips parted as if to cry out. They emitted no sound, and
      she turned with a terrified fascination and looked back. The shutter had
      opened; there was no glass; the small square of the window showed the
      nebulous gray mist without, and defined upon it was Evelina's head, her
      dark hair streaming over the red shawl held about it, her fair oval face
      pallid and pensive, and with a great wistfulness upon it; her lustrous
      dark eyes glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; her red lips quivered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old crone recognized no treachery in her heart. She laid a warning
      finger upon her lips. All the men were asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evelina stretched out her yearning arms. &ldquo;Gin him ter me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw, naw, Eveliny,&rdquo; huskily whispered Absalom's mother. &ldquo;Ye oughter kem
      hyar an' 'bide with yer husband&mdash;ye know ye ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evelina still held out her insistent arms. &ldquo;Gin him ter me!&rdquo; she pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman shook her head sternly. &ldquo;Ye kem in, an' 'bide whar ye
      b'long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evelina took a step nearer the window. She laid her hand on the sill.
      &ldquo;Spos'n 'twar Abs'lom whenst he war a baby,&rdquo; she said, her eyes softly
      brightening, &ldquo;an' another woman hed him an' kep' him, 'kase ye an' his dad
      fell out&mdash;would ye hev 'lowed she war right ter treat ye like ye
      treat me&mdash;whenst Abs'lom war a baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more she held out her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a step in the inner shed-room; then silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye hain't got no excuse,&rdquo; the soft voice urged; &ldquo;ye know jes how I feel,
      how ye'd hev felt, whenst Abs'lom war a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shawl had fallen back from her tender face; her eyes glowed, her cheek
      was softly flushed. A sudden terror thrilled through her as she again
      heard the heavy step approaching in the shed-room. &ldquo;Whenst Abs'lom war a
      baby,&rdquo; she reiterated, her whole pleading heart in the tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden radiance seemed to illumine the sad, dun-colored folds of the
      encompassing cloud; her face shone with a transfiguring happiness, for the
      hustling old crone had handed out to her a warm, somnolent bundle, and the
      shutter closed upon the mists with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind's riz powerful suddint,&rdquo; Peter said, noticing the noise as he
      came stumbling in, rubbing his eyes. He went and fastened the shutter,
      while his mother tremulously mended the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The absence of the baby was not noticed for some time, and when the
      father's hasty and angry questions elicited the reluctant facts, the
      outcry for his loss was hardly less bitter among the Kittredges than among
      the Quimbeys. The fugitives were shielded from capture by the enveloping
      mist, and when Absalom returned from the search he could do naught but
      indignantly upbraid his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0003" id="linkimage-0003">

    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%">
      <img src="images/133.jpg" alt="Flung Her Apron over Her Head 133 "   width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      She was terrified by her own deed, and cowered under Absalom's wrath. It
      was in a moral collapse, she felt, that she could have done this thing.
      She flung her apron over her head, and sat still and silent&mdash;a
      monumental figure&mdash;among them. Once, roused by Absalom's reproaches,
      she made some effort to defend and exculpate herself, speaking from behind
      the enveloping apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't born no Kittredge nohow,&rdquo; she irrelevantly asseverated, &ldquo;an' I
      never war. An' when Eveliny axed me how I'd hev liked ter hev another
      'oman take Abs'lom whenst he war a baby, I couldn't hold out no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; cried Absalom, unfilially; &ldquo;ye'd aheap better be a-studyin'
      'bout'n my good now 'n whenst I war a baby&mdash;a-givin' away <i>my</i>
      child ter them Quimbeys; a-h'istin' him out'n the winder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was glad to retort that he was &ldquo;impident,&rdquo; and to take refuge in an
      aggrieved silence, as many another mother has done when outmatched by
      logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this there was more cheerfulness in her hidden face than might have
      been argued from her port of important sorrow. &ldquo;Bes' ter hev no jawin',
      though,&rdquo; she said to herself, as she sat thus inscrutably veiled. And deep
      in her repentant heart she was contradictorily glad that Evelina and the
      baby were safe together down in the Cove.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Old Joel Quimbey, putting on his spectacles, with a look of keenest
      curiosity, to read a paper which the deputy-sheriff of the county
      presented when he drew rein by the wood-pile one afternoon some three
      weeks later, had some difficulty in identifying a certain Elnathan Daniel
      Kittredge specified therein. He took off his spectacles, rubbed them
      smartly, and put them on again. The writing was unchanged. Surely it must
      mean the baby. That was the only Kittredge whose body they could be
      summoned to produce on the 24th of December before the judge of the
      circuit court, now in session. He turned the paper about and looked at it,
      his natural interest as a man augmented by his recognition as an
      ex-magistrate of its high important legal character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eveliny,&rdquo; he quavered, at once flattered and furious, &ldquo;dad-burned ef
      Abs'lom hain't gone an' got out a <i>habeas corpus</i> fur the baby!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The phrase had a sound so deadly that there was much ado to satisfactorily
      explain the writ and its functions to Evelina, who had felt at ease again
      since the baby was at home, and so effectually guarded that to kidnap him
      was necessarily to murder two or three of the vigilant and stalwart
      Quimbey men. So much joy did it afford the old man to air his learning and
      consult his code&mdash;a relic of his justiceship&mdash;that he belittled
      the danger of losing the said Elnathan Daniel Kittredge in the interest
      with which he looked forward to the day for him to be produced before the
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gathering of the clans on that day. Quimbeys and Kittredges
      who had not visited the town for twenty years were jogging thither betimes
      that morning on the red clay roads, all unimpeded by the deep mud which,
      frozen into stiff ruts and ridges here and there, made the way hazardous
      to the running-gear. The lagging winter had come, and the ground was half
      covered with a light fall of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows of the court-house were white with frost; the weighted doors
      clanged continuously. An old codger, slowly ascending the steps, and
      pushing into the semi-obscurity of the hall, paused as the door slammed
      behind him, stared at the sheriff in surprise, then fixed him with a
      bantering leer. The light that slanted through the open court-room door
      fell upon the official's burly figure, his long red beard, his big
      broad-brimmed hat pushed back from his laughing red face, consciously
      ludicrous and abashed just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hev ye made a find?&rdquo; demanded the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in the strong arms of the law sat, bolt-upright, Elnathan Daniel
      Kittredge, his yellow head actively turning about, his face decorated with
      a grin, and on most congenial terms with the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're lawin' 'bout'n him in thar &ldquo;&mdash;the sheriff jerked his thumb
      toward the door. &ldquo;<i>Habeas corpus</i> perceedin's. Dun no ez I ever see a
      friskier leetle cuss. Durned ef I 'ain't got a good mind ter run off with
      him myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The said Elnathan Daniel Kittredge once more squirmed round and settled
      himself comfortably in the hollow of the sheriff's elbow, who marvelled to
      find himself so deft in holding him, for it was twenty years since his son&mdash;a
      gawky youth who now affected the company at the saloon, and was none too
      filial&mdash;was the age and about the build of this infant Kittredge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hed a reg'lar scrimmage hyar in the hall&mdash;them fool men&mdash;Quimbey
      an' Kittredge. Old man Quimbey said suthin' ter Abs'lom Kittredge&mdash;I
      dunno what all. Abs'lom never jawed back none. He jes made a dart an'
      snatched this hyar leetle critter out'n his mother's arms, stiddier
      waitin' fur the law, what he summonsed himself. Blest ef I didn't hev ter
      hold my revolver ter his head, an' then crack him over the knuckles, ter
      make him let go the child. I didn't want ter arrest him&mdash;mighty
      clever boy, Abs'lom Kittredge! I promised that young woman I'd keep holt
      o' the child till the law gins its say-so. I feel sorry fur her; she's
      been through a heap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, ye look mighty pritty, totin' him around hyar,&rdquo; his friend
      encouraged him with a grin. &ldquo;I'll say that fur ye&mdash;ye look mighty
      pritty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in fact the merriment in the hall at the sheriff's expense began to
      grow so exhilarating as to make him feel that the proceedings within were
      too interesting to lose. His broad red face with its big red beard
      reappeared in the doorway&mdash;slightly embarrassed because of the
      sprightly manners of his charge, who challenged to mirth every eye that
      glanced at him by his toothful grin and his gurgles and bounces; he was
      evidently enjoying the excitement and his conspicuous position. He
      manfully gnawed at his corn-dodger from time to time, and from the manner
      in which he fraternized with his new acquaintance, the sheriff, he seemed
      old enough to dispense with maternal care, and, but for his incomplete
      methods of locomotion, able to knock about town with the boys. The
      Quimbeys took note of his mature demeanor with sinking hearts; they looked
      anxiously at the judge, wondering if he had ever before seen such
      precocity&mdash;anything so young to be so old: &ldquo;He 'ain't never afore
      'peared so survigrus&mdash;so <i>durned survigrus</i> ez he do ter-day,&rdquo;
       they whispered to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; his father was saying, on examination, &ldquo;year old. Eats
      anything he kin git&mdash;cabbage an' fat meat an' anything. <i>Could</i>
      walk if he wanted ter. But he 'ain't been raised right&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced
      at his wife to observe the effect of this statement. He felt a pang as he
      noted her pensive, downcast face, all tremulous and agitated, overwhelmed
      as she was by the crowd and the infinite moment of the decision. But
      Absalom, too, had his griefs, and they expressed themselves perversely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hev been pompered an' fattened by bein' let ter eat an' sleep so much,
      till he be so heavy ter his self he don't wanter take the trouble ter get
      about. He <i>could</i> walk ennywhar. He's plumb survigrus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as if in confirmation, the youthful Kittredge lifted his voice to
      display his lung power. He hilariously babbled, and suddenly roared out a
      stentorian whoop, elicited by nothing in particular, then caught the
      sheriff's beard, and buried in it his conscious pink face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge looked gravely up over his spectacles. He had a bronzed
      complexion, a serious, pondering expression, a bald head, and a gray
      beard. He wore a black broadcloth suit, somewhat old-fashioned in cut, and
      his black velvet waist-coat had suffered an eruption of tiny red satin
      spots. He had great respect for judicial decorums, and no Kittredge,
      however youthful, or survigrus, or exalted in importance by <i>habeas
      corpus</i> proceedings, could &ldquo;holler&rdquo; unmolested where he presided.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sheriff,&rdquo; he said, solemnly, &ldquo;remove that child from the presence of
      the court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the said Elnathan Daniel Kittredge went out gleefully kicking in the
      arms of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hundred or so grinning faces in the courtroom relapsed quickly into
      gravity and excited interest. The rows of jeans-clad countrymen seated
      upon the long benches on either side of the bar leaned forward with intent
      attitudes. For this was a rich feast of local gossip, such as had not been
      so bountifully spread within their recollection. All the ancient Quimbey
      and Kittredge feuds contrived to be detailed anew in offering to the judge
      reasons why father or mother was the more fit custodian of the child in
      litigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Absalom sat listening to all this, his eyes were suddenly arrested by
      his wife's face&mdash;half draped it was, half shadowed by her sun-bonnet,
      its fine and delicate profile distinctly outlined against the crystalline
      and frosted pane of the window near which she sat. The snow without threw
      a white reflection upon it; its rich coloring in contrast was the more
      intense; it was very pensive, with the heavy lids drooping over the
      lustrous eyes, and with a pathetic appeal in its expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly his thoughts wandered far afield. He wondered that it had
      come to this; that she could have misunderstood him so; that he had
      thought her hard and perverse and unforgiving. His heart was all at once
      melting within him; somehow he was reminded how slight a thing she was,
      and how strong was the power that nerved her slender hand to drag his
      heavy weight, in his dead and helpless unconsciousness, down to the bars
      and into the safety of the sheltering laurel that night, when he lay
      wounded and bleeding under the lighted window of the cabin in the Cove. A
      deep tenderness, an irresistible yearning had come upon him; he was about
      to rise, he was about to speak he knew not what, when suddenly her face
      was irradiated as one who sees a blessed vision; a happy light sprang into
      her eyes; her lips curved with a smile; the quick tears dropped one by one
      on her hands, nervously clasping and unclasping each other. He was
      bewildered for a moment. Then he heard Peter gruffly growling a
      half-whispered curse, and the voice of the judge, in the exercise of his
      discretion, methodically droning out his reasons for leaving so young a
      child in the custody of its mother, disregarding the paramount rights of
      the father. The judge concluded by dispassionately recommending the young
      couple to betake themselves home, and to try to live in peace together,
      or, at any rate, like sane people. Then he thrust his spectacles up on his
      forehead, drew a long sigh of dismissal, and said, with a freshened look
      of interest, &ldquo;Mr. Clerk, call the next case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Quimbey and Kittredge factions poured into the hall; what cared they
      for the disputed claims of Jenkins <i>versus</i> Jones? The lovers of
      sensation cherished a hope that there might be a lawless effort to rescue
      the infant Kittredge from the custody to which he had been committed by
      the court. The Quimbeys watchfully kept about him in a close squad, his
      pink sun-bonnet, in which his head was eclipsed, visible among their
      brawny jeans shoulders, as his mother carried him in her arms. The sheriff
      looked smilingly after him from the court-house steps, then inhaled a long
      breath, and began to roar out to the icy air the name of a witness wanted
      within. Instead of a gate there was a flight of steps on each side of the
      fence, surmounted by a small platform. Evelina suddenly shrank back as she
      stood on the platform, for beside the fence Absalom was waiting. Timothy
      hastily vaulted over the fence, drew his &ldquo;shooting-iron&rdquo; from his
      boot-leg, and cocked it with a metallic click, sharp and peremptory in the
      keen wintry air. For a moment Absalom said not a word. He looked up at
      Evelina with as much reproach as bitterness in his dark eyes. They were
      bright with the anger that fired his blood; it was hot in his bronzed
      cheek; it quivered in his hands. The dry and cold atmosphere amplified the
      graces of his long curling yellow hair that she and his mother loved. His
      hat was pushed back from his face. He had not spoken to her since the day
      of his ill-starred confidence, but he would not be denied now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye'll repent it,&rdquo; he said, threateningly. &ldquo;I'll take special pains fur
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bestowed on him one defiant glance, and laughed&mdash;a bitter little
      laugh. &ldquo;Ye air ekal ter it; ye have a special gift fur makin' folks repent
      they ever seen ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The jedge jes gin him ter ye 'kase ye made him out sech a fibble little
      pusson,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;But it's jes fur a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held the baby closer. He busied himself in taking off his sun-bonnet
      and putting it on hind part before, gurgling with smothered laughter to
      find himself thus queerly masked, and he made futile efforts to play
      &ldquo;peep-eye&rdquo; with anybody jovially disposed in the crowd. But they were all
      gravely absorbed in the conjugal quarrel at which they were privileged to
      assist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's jes fur a time,&rdquo; he reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait an' see!&rdquo; she retorted, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't wait,&rdquo; he declared, goaded; &ldquo;I'll take him yit; an' when I do
      I'll clar out'n the State o' Tennessee&mdash;see ef I don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned white and trembled. &ldquo;Ye dassent,&rdquo; she cried out shrilly. &ldquo;Ye'll
      be 'feared o' the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait an' see!&rdquo; He mockingly echoed her words, and turned in his old
      confident manner, and strode out of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faint and trembling, she crept into the old canvas-covered wagon, and as
      it jogged along down the road stiff with its frozen ruts and ever nearing
      the mountains, she clasped the cheerful Kittredge with a yearning sense of
      loss, and declared that the judge had made him no safer than before. It
      was in vain that her father, speaking from the legal lore of the code,
      detailed the contempt of court that the Kittredges would commit should
      they undertake to interfere with the judicial decision&mdash;it might be
      even considered kidnapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what good would that do me&mdash;an' the baby whisked plumb out'n the
      State? Ef Abs'lom ain't 'feared o' Tim's rifle, what's he goin' ter keer
      fur the pore jedge with nare weepon but his leetle contempt o' court&mdash;ter
      jail Abs'lom, ef he kin make out ter ketch him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned against the swaying hoop of the cover of the wagon and burst
      into tears. &ldquo;Oh, none o' ye 'll do nuthin' fur me!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in
      frantic reproach. &ldquo;Nuthin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye talk like 'twar we-uns ez made up sech foolishness ez <i>habeas corpus</i>
      out'n our own heads,&rdquo; said Timothy. &ldquo;I 'ain't never looked ter the law fur
      pertection. Hyar's the pertecter.&rdquo; He touched the trigger of his rifle and
      glanced reassuringly at his sister as he sat beside her on the plank laid
      as a seat from side to side of the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She calmed herself for a moment; then suddenly looked aghast at the rifle,
      and with some occult and hideous thought, burst anew into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waal, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Stephen, outdone, &ldquo;what with all this hyar daily
      weepin' an' nightly mournin', I 'ain't got spunk enough lef ter stan' up
      agin the leetlest Kittredge a-goin'. I ain't man enough ter sight a rifle.
      Kittredges kin kem enny time an' take my hide, horns, an' tallow ef they
      air minded so ter do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'lowed I hearn suthin' a-gallopin' down the road,&rdquo; said Tim, abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tears suddenly ceased. She clutched the baby closer, and turned and
      lifted the flap of the white curtain at the back of the wagon, and looked
      out with a wild and terror-stricken eye. The red clay road stretched
      curveless, a long way visible and vacant. The black bare trees stood
      shivering in the chilly blast on either side; among them was an occasional
      clump of funereal cedars. Away off the brown wooded hills rose; snow lay
      in thin crust-like patches here and there, and again the earth wore the
      pallid gray of the crab-grass or the ochreous red of the gully-washed
      clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see nuthin',&rdquo; she said, in the bated voice of affrighted
      suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she still looked out flakes suddenly began to fly, hardly falling at
      first, but poised tentatively, fluctuating athwart the scene, presently
      thickening, quickening, obscuring it all, isolating the woods with an
      added sense of solitude since the sight of the world and the sound of it
      were so speedily annulled. Even the creak of the wagon-wheels was muffled.
      Through the semicircular aperture in the front of the wagon-cover the
      horns of the oxen were dimly seen amidst the serried flakes; the snow
      whitened the backs of the beasts and added its burden to their yoke. Once
      as they jogged on she fancied again that she heard hoof-beats&mdash;this
      time a long way ahead, thundering over a little bridge high above a
      swirling torrent, that reverberated with a hollow tone to the faintest
      footfall. &ldquo;Jes somebody ez hev passed we-uns, takin' the short-cut by the
      bridle-path,&rdquo; she ruminated. No pursuer, evidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was deeply submerged in the snow before they reached the dark
      little cabin nestling in the Cove. Motionless and dreary it was; not even
      a blue and gauzy wreath curled out of the chimney, for the fire had died
      on the hearth in their absence. No living creature was to be seen. The
      fowls were huddled together in the hen-house, and the dogs had accompanied
      the family to town, trotting beneath the wagon with lolling tongues and
      smoking breath; when they nimbly climbed the fence their circular
      footprints were the first traces to mar the level expanse of the
      door-yard. The bare limbs of the trees were laden; the cedars bore great
      flower-like tufts amidst the interlacing fibrous foliage. The eaves were
      heavily thatched; the drifts lay in the fence corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was covered except, indeed, one side of the fodder-stack that
      stood close to the barn. Evelina, going out to milk the cow, gazed at it
      for a moment in surprise. The snow had slipped down from it, and lay in
      rolls and piles about the base, intermixed with the sere husks and blades
      that seemed torn out of the great cone. &ldquo;Waal, sir, Spot mus' hev been
      hongry fur true, ter kem a-foragin' this wise. Looks ez ef she hev been
      fairly a-burrowin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and glanced over her shoulder at tracks in the snow&mdash;shapeless
      holes, and filling fast&mdash;which she did not doubt were the footprints
      of the big red cow, standing half in and half out of the wide door, slowly
      chewing her cud, her breath visibly curling out on the chill air, her
      great lips opening to emit a muttered low. She moved forward suddenly into
      the shelter as Evelina started anew toward it, holding the piggin in one
      hand and clasping the baby in the other arm.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Evelina noted the sound of her brothers' two axes, busy at the wood-pile,
      their regular cleavage splitting the air with a sharp stroke and bringing
      a crystalline shivering echo from the icy mountain. She did not see the
      crouching figure that came cautiously burrowing out from the stack.
      Absalom rose to his full height, looking keenly about him the while, and
      stole noiselessly in the soft snow to the stable, and peered in through a
      crevice in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evelina had placed the piggin upon the straw-covered ground, and stood
      among the horned cattle and the huddling sheep, her soft melancholy face
      half shaded by the red shawl thrown over her head and shoulders. A tress
      of her brown hair escaped and curled about her white neck, and hung down
      over the bosom of her dark-blue homespun dress. Against her shoulder the
      dun-colored cow rubbed her horned head. The baby was in a pensive mood,
      and scarcely babbled. The reflection of the snow was on his face,
      heightening the exquisite purity of the tints of his infantile complexion.
      His gentle, fawn-like eyes were full of soft and lustrous languors. His
      long lashes drooped over them now, and again were lifted. His short down
      of yellow hair glimmered golden against the red shawl over his mother's
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the beasts sank slowly upon the ground&mdash;a tired creature
      doubtless, and night was at hand; then another, and still another. Their
      posture reminded Absalom, as he looked, that this was Christmas Eve, and
      of the old superstition that the cattle of the barns spend the night upon
      their knees, in memory of the wondrous Presence that once graced their
      lowly place. The boughs rattled suddenly in the chill blast above his
      head; the drifts fell about him. He glanced up mechanically to see in the
      zenith a star of gracious glister, tremulous and tender, in the rifts of
      the breaking clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder ef it air the same star o' Bethlehem?&rdquo; he said, thinking of the
      great sidereal torch heralding the Light of the World. He had a vague
      sense that this star has never set, however the wandering planets may come
      and go in their wide journeys as the seasons roll. He looked again into
      the glooming place, at the mother and her child, remembering that the Lord
      of heaven and earth had once lain in a manger, and clung to a humble
      earthly mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook with a sudden affright. He had intended to wrest the child
      from her grasp, and mount and ride away; he was roused from his reverie by
      the thrusting upon him of his opportunity, facilitated a hundredfold.
      Evelina had evidently forgotten something. She hesitated for a moment;
      then put the baby down upon a great pile of straw among the horned
      creatures, and, catching her shawl about her head, ran swiftly to the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absalom moved mechanically into the doorway. The child, still pensive and
      silent, and looking tenderly infantile, lay upon the straw. A sudden pang
      of pity for her pierced his heart: how her own would be desolated! His
      horse, hitched in a clump of cedars, awaited him ten steps away. It was
      his only chance&mdash;his last chance. And he had been hardly entreated.
      The child's eyes rested, startled and dilated, upon him; he must be quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next instant he turned suddenly, ran hastily through the snow, crashed
      among the cedars, mounted his horse, and galloped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a moment that Evelina expected to be at the house, but the
      gourd of salt which she sought was not in its place. She hurried out with
      it at last, unprescient of any danger until all at once she saw the
      footprints of a man in the snow, otherwise untrodden, about the
      fodder-stack. She still heard the two axes at the wood-pile. Her father,
      she knew, was at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smothered scream escaped her lips. The steps had evidently gone into the
      stable, and had come out thence. Her faltering strength could scarcely
      support her to the door. And then she saw lying in the straw Elnathan
      Daniel, beginning to babble and gurgle again, and to grow very pink with
      joy over a new toy&mdash;a man's glove, a red woollen glove, accidentally
      dropped in the straw. She caught it from his hands, and turned it about
      curiously. She had knit it herself&mdash;for Absalom!
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came into the house, beaming with joy, the baby holding the glove
      in his hands, the men listened to her in dumfounded amaze, and with
      significant side glances at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn't take the baby whenst he hed the chance, 'kase he knowed
      'twould hurt me so. An' he never wanted ter torment me&mdash;I reckon he
      never <i>did</i> mean ter torment me. An' he did 'low wunst he war sorry
      he spited dad. Oh! I hev been a heap too quick an' spiteful myself. I hev
      been so terrible wrong! Look a-hyar; he lef' this glove ter show me he hed
      been hyar, an' could hev tuk the baby ef he hed hed the heart ter do it.
      Oh! I'm goin' right up the mounting an' tell him how sorry I be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toler'ble cheap!&rdquo; grumbled Stephen&mdash;&ldquo;one old glove. An' he'll git
      Elnathan Daniel an' ye too. A smart fox he be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could not dissuade her. And after a time it came to pass that the
      Quimbey and Kittredge feuds were healed; for how could the heart of a
      grandfather withstand a toddling spectacle in pink calico that ran away
      one day some two years later, in company with an adventurous dog, and came
      down the mountain to the cabin in the Cove, squeezing through the fence
      rails after the manner of his underfoot world, proceeding thence to the
      house, where he made himself very merry and very welcome?

    <p>
      And when Tim mounted his horse and rode up the mountain with the youngster
      on the pommel of the saddle, lest Evelina should be out of her mind with
      fright because of his absence, how should he and old Mrs. Kittredge differ
      in their respective opinions of his vigorous growth, and grace of
      countenance, and peartness of manner? On the strength of this concurrence
      Tim was induced to &ldquo;'light an' hitch,&rdquo; and he even sat on the cabin porch
      and talked over the crops with Absalom, who, the next time he went to
      town, stopped at the cabin in the Cove to bring word how El-nathan Daniel
      was &ldquo;thrivin'.&rdquo; The path that Evelina had worn to the crag in those first
      homesick days on the mountain rapidly extended itself into the Cove, and
      widened and grew smooth, as the grandfather went up and the grandson came
      down.
